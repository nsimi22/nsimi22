# 👋 Hi, I'm Nick Simi (@nsimi22)

## About Me
I'm a **Product Manager** who bridges the gap between business strategy and technical execution. I don't just manage products—I build them, ship them, and iterate on them with a hands-on approach that keeps me close to the code and the customer.

## 🚀 My Approach: Vibe Coding with AI

I've embraced **AI-powered development** as a force multiplier for product velocity. Using tools like Claude Code, I've transformed how I work:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: From idea to working code in minutes, not days
- **Full-Stack Fluency**: Jumping between React frontends, Laravel backends, and database migrations without context switching friction
- **Documentation as Code**: Keeping technical documentation accurate by having AI verify it against the actual codebase
- **Smart Debugging**: AI helps me trace complex issues across codebases, identify root causes, and implement fixes with surgical precision

### Recent Wins
- Built commission calculation documentation for complex dealer payment structures
- Implemented DNC (Do Not Contact) compliance fixes with single-file precision PRs
- Shipped feature flags, permission systems, and UI improvements across multiple projects
- Maintained zero-downtime deployments while iterating on production systems

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Material-UI, Webpack
- **Backend**: Laravel 9, PHP 8.1+, MySQL
- **Tools**: Git, Jira, Confluence, Claude Code
- **Methodologies**: Agile/Scrum, CI/CD, Test-Driven Development

## 💡 What I Believe
- **Product managers should code**: Staying technical makes me a better PM
- **AI is a teammate, not a replacement**: It amplifies human creativity and judgment
- **Ship fast, iterate faster**: Velocity matters when you have tight feedback loops
- **Documentation lives with the code**: If the docs are wrong, the AI should catch it
